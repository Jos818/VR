[NAME=Player][SPEAKERSPRITE=][PITCH=2]Woah!
[NAME=Salesman][SPEAKERSPRITE=][PITCH=3]As you can see, the Securacam even gives you the extra foot of height that your genes denied you!
Is there nothing the Securacam can't do?
I will note that the Securcacm has automatically flipped its direction to mirror the direction you're facing. A must when you're moving the camera away from the meatloaf smoke.
To make moving around even easier when you're holding the Securacam there's the Automatic Rotation. This means it will rotate horizontally with WASD while you hold it. Try spinning around a bit!
And when you're ready to get back to the demo. You can set the Securacam back on the table by tapping Space Bar.
