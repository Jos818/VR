[NAME=Salesman][SPEAKERSPRITE=][PITCH=3]Now instead of tapping Space Bar to drop the Securacam, I want you to hold it, and charge up all your strength. Then, when you're ready, release Space Bar to throw the Securacam across the room!
Don't worry about damaging it. Any repairs or replacements will be coming directly out of my salary.
Oh! And if you feel like you're throwing it too far, feel free to press Control to cancel the charge.
